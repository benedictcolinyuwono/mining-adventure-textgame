Welcome to Oreopolis!

In this mining site, you will find many precious ores that you can mine freely with the backpack and pickaxes
we provide you. However, we must warn you, these backpacks are limited and the pickaxes are not the most durable
and its durability will reduce for every rock/ore mined. Thankfully, you can use the ores that you mine to gain
money and refresh your pickaxe's durability. These are very costly so be mindful of what you mine and when.

Rules:
1. Win condition: get 1000 money (you lose if you run out of moves without getting 1000 money first.
2. 3 types of ores
    - Gold ore = 100 money
    - Silver ore = 50 money
    - Iron ore = 20 money
3. Players start with 15 moves (pickaxe durability).
4. 60 money = +5 moves (restore pickaxe durability).
5. Backpack has a maximum capacity of 10 ores.

Enjoy Oreopolis!
